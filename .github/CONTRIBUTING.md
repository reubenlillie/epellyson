# How to contribute

I’m really glad you’re reading this. We need your help to optimize the electronic _Manual of the Church of the Nazarene_ for a global readership.

If you haven't already, please reach out via direct message over social media: 

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reubenlillie)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/reubenlillie)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reubenlillie/)

Here are some important resources:

* [Main site wiki](https://github.com/reubenlillie/manual/wiki) covers the _Manual_ content itself
* [Theme wiki (this repository)](https://github.com/reubenlillie/epellyson/wiki) breaks down coding standards
* [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) explains why the codebase is organized the way it is 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub pull request to the theme repository](https://github.com/reubenlillie/epellyson/pulls) with a clear list of what you’ve done. (Fore more infomration about pull requests see http://help.github.com/pull-requests/). Please follow our coding standards outlined in the [theme wiki](https://github.com/reubenlillie/epellyson/wiki). And plase make all of your commits “atomic” (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding Standards

Here are some quick links to our coding standards. We want to keep our code readable and backwards compatible.
